//! The **injected** System-DB seam (the vendor-free analogue of `qfs-driver-sql`'s
//! `SqlBackend`). The introspective driver half is pure; the impure read/write half — the
//! rusqlite I/O over the System DB (and the Project DB's connection registry) — is provided by
//! the `qfs` binary leaf through this trait, so this crate stays tokio-free and DB-free (the
//! dep-direction guard: only the terminal binary opens a real DB path, decision F).
//!
//! No vendor (rusqlite) type crosses this boundary — only owned qfs DTOs (`RowBatch`, the
//! [`SysNode`] tag, and the structured [`SysError`]).
